 @brief This class implements the MovementIndex feature module.  The MovementIndex module computes the amount of
 movement or variation within an N-dimensional signal over a given time window.  The MovementIndex class
 is good for extracting features that describe how much change is occuring in an N-dimensional signal over
 time.  An example application might be to use the MovementIndex in combination with one of the GRT classification
 algorithms to determine if an object is being moved or held still.
