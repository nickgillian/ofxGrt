 @brief The SOMQuantizer module quantizes the N-dimensional input vector to a 1-dimensional discrete value. 
 This value will be between [0 K-1], where K is the number of clusters used to create the quantization model. 
 Before you use the SOMQuantizer, you need to train a quantization model. To do this, you select the number 
 of clusters you want your quantizer to have and then give it any training data in the following formats:
 - ClassificationData
 - TimeSeriesClassificationData
 - ClassificationDataStream
 - UnlabelledClassificationData
 - MatrixFloat
