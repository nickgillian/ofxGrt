 @section DESCRIPTION
 The ZeroCrossingCounter class counts the number of zero crossings that occur in an N dimensional signal over a given window. 
 
 The ZeroCrossingCounter stores the incoming N dimensional signal in a circular buffer, it then computes two main features from the data in this buffer, these are:
 zero-crossing count: the number of times the derivative of the input signal crosses zero within the buffer
 zero-crossing magnitude: the absolute sum of the input signal at the locations where the derivative of the input signal crosses zero within the buffer
 
 The ZeroCrossingCounter can compute these features in two modes: INDEPENDANT_FEATURE_MODE or COMBINED_FEATURE_MODE. 
 
 In INDEPENDANT_FEATURE_MODE the zero-crossing count and zero-crossing magnitude features will be computed independently for each of the N dimensions in the input signal. 
 In COMBINED_FEATURE_MODE the zero-crossing count and zero-crossing magnitude features will be integrated across all of the N dimensions in the input signal.
 This means that if the ZeroCrossingCounter is set to INDEPENDANT_FEATURE_MODE, the size of the output feature vector will be 2 * N, where 2 is the two features (zero-crossing count and zero-crossing magnitude) and N is the number of dimensions in the input signal. Alternatively in COMBINED_FEATURE_MODE the size of the output vector will simply be 2, where 2 is the two features (zero-crossing count and zero-crossing magnitude). The feature modes can be set either in the ZeroCrossingCounter constructor or by using the setFeatureMode(UINT featureMode) function.
 
 The ZeroCrossingCounter class is part of the Feature Extraction Modules.
