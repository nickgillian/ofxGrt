 @brief This class runs the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, a dimensionality reduction algorithm that 
 projects an [M N] matrix (where M==samples and N==dimensions) onto a new K dimensional subspace, where K is
 normally much less than N.
 
 This projection or transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest 
 possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding 
 component has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it be orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) 
 the preceding components. Principal components are guaranteed to be independent only if the data set is jointly 
 normally distributed. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.
 
 The PCA algorithm will automatically mean subtract the input data, and also normalize the data if required.  To use
 this algorithm, the user should first run the computeFeatureVector(...) function to build the PCA feature vector and
 then run the project(...) function to project new data onto the new principal subspace.
 
 @remark This implementation is based on Bishop, Christopher M. Pattern recognition and machine learning. Vol. 1. New York: springer, 2006.
