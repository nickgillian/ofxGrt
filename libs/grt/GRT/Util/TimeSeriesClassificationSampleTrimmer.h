 @brief This class provides a useful tool to automatically trim timeseries data.

  Sometimes, when a user records a timeseries example, there is a significant pause at the start and end of the example 
  where the recording has started but the user has not started to move yet.  These areas of 'static' data (at the start 
  and end of a recording) can generate poor classification models (as the classification model expects to see similar 
  static data in the real time data).

  The LabelledTimeSeriesClassificationSampleTrimmer attempts to detect and remove these static areas of data. This is done
  by computing the summed absolute energy of the timeseries data, normalizing the energy profile by the maximum energy value,
  and then searching for areas at the start and end of the timeseries that are below a specific trimthreshold (set by the user).
  Any data that is below the trimthreshold will be removed, up until the first value that exceeds the threshold.  This search is
  run both from the start of the timeseries (searching forward) and the end of the timeseries (searching backwards).  If the length
  of the new timeseries is below the maximumTrimPercentage, then the timeseries will be trimmed and the trimTimeSeries function
  will return true.  If the length of the new is above the maximumTrimPercentage, then the timeseries will not be trimmed and the
  trimTimeSeries function will return false. Set the maximumTrimPercentage to 100 if you want the timeseries to always be trimmed.
