 @brief The TimeSeriesClassificationData is the main data structure for recording, labeling, managing, saving, and loading training data for supervised temporal learning problems. Unlike the ClassificationData, in which each sample consists of 1 N dimensional datum, a TimeSeriesClassificationData sample will consist of an N dimensional time series of length M. The length of each time series sample (i.e. M) can be different for each datum in the dataset.
