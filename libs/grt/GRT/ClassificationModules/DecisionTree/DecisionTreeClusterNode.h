 @brief This file implements a DecisionTreeClusterNode, which is a specific type of node used for a DecisionTree.
 
 @description The node creates a spilt for each node in a DecisionTree by finding the threshold and feature that minimizes 
 the error on the training data at that node.  The threshold is found by using KMeans to find two clusters in the training data
 for each feature, with the threshold being set as the centroid between each cluster.
