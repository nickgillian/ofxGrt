 @version 1.0
 
 @brief This class contains the AdaBoost classifier. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a powerful classifier that works well on both basic and more complex 
 recognition problems. 
 
 AdaBoost works by creating a highly accurate classifier by combining many relatively weak and inaccurate
 classifiers. AdaBoost therefore acts as a meta algorithm, which allows you to use it as a wrapper for other classifiers. 
 In the GRT, these classifiers are called Weak Classifiers such as a GRT::DecisionStump (which is just one node of a DecisionTree). 
 AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers added at each round of boosting are tweaked in favor of those 
 instances misclassified by previous classifiers. The default number of boosting rounds for AdaBoost is 20, however 
 this can easily be set using the GRT::AdaBoost::setNumBoostingIterations(UINT numBoostingIterations) function or 
 via the AdaBoost constructor.

 @remark This implementation is based on Schapire, Robert E., and Yoav Freund. Boosting: Foundations and Algorithms. MIT Press, 2012.
 
 @note   There are two classification modes, GRT::AdaBoost::PredictionMethods (MAX_POSITIVE_VALE and MAX_VALUE), which can give
         different classification results so you should experiment with each mode to achieve the best results for your classification task.
