 @version 1.0
 
 @brief The Softmax Classifier is a simple but effective classifier (based on logisitc regression) that works well on problems that are linearly separable.
 
 @example ClassificationModulesExamples/SoftmaxExample/SoftmaxExample.cpp
 
 @remark This implementation is based on Bishop, Christopher M. Pattern recognition and machine learning. Vol. 1. New York: springer, 2006.
