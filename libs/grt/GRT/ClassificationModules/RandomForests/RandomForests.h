 @brief This class implements a Random Decision Forest classifier.

 Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that operate by building a number of decision 
 trees at training time and outputting the class with the majority vote over all the trees in the ensemble.
 
 @example ClassificationModulesExamples/RandomForestsExample/RandomForestsExample.cpp
 
 @remark This implementation is based on Breiman, Leo. "Random forests." Machine learning 45, no. 1 (2001): 5-32.
