 @version 1.0
 
 @brief This class implements the bootstrap aggregator classifier.  Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is a machine 
 learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of other machine learning 
 algorithms.  Bagging also reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied 
 to decision tree methods, the BAG class can be used with any type of GRT classifier. Bagging is a special case of 
 the model averaging.
 
 @remark This implementation is based on Breiman, Leo. "Bagging predictors." Machine learning 24, no. 2 (1996): 123-140.
