     Constructor, sets the filter factor, gain and dimensionality of the low pass filter.

     If the cutoffFrequency and delta values are kept at their default values of -1 then the values will be ignored and the filter factor will be used instead.
     Otherwise the fiterFactor will control the low pass filter, with a smaller filterFactor (i.e. 0.1) resulting in a more aggresive smoothing
     of the input signal.  The filterFactor should be in the range [0.0 1.0].
	 
     @param filterFactor: controls the low pass filter, a smaller value will result in a more aggresive smoothing of the input signal. Default value filterFactor = 0.1

     @param numDimensions: the dimensionality of the input data to filter.  Default numDimensions = 1
     @param cutoffFrequency: sets the cutoffFrequency of the filter (in Hz). If the cutoffFrequency and delta values are set then the filter will be initialized with these values rather than the filterFactor.  Default value cutoffFrequency = -1.0
     @param delta: the sampling rate of your sensor, delta should be set as 1.0/SR, where SR is the sampling rate of your sensor.  Default value delta = -1.0
