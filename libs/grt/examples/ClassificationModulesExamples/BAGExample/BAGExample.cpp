/*
 GRT BAG Example
 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the BAG algorithm for classification.
 
 The BAG classifier implements bootstrap aggregating (bagging), a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm 
 designed to improve the stability and accuracy of other machine learning algorithms.  Bagging also reduces 
 variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, the BAG 
 class can be used with any type of GRT classifier.
 
 In this example we create an instance of a BAG algorithm, add several classifiers to the BAG ensemble and then
 train a BAG model using some pre-recorded training data.  The trained BAG model is then used to predict the 
 class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create an initialize the BAG algorithm
 - Add several classifiers to the BAG ensemble
 - Load some ClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train a BAG model using the training dataset
 - Test the model using the test dataset
 - Compute the accuracy of the classifier

You should run this example with one argument pointing to the data you want to load. A good dataset to run this example is acc-orientation.grt, which can be found in the GRT data folder.
