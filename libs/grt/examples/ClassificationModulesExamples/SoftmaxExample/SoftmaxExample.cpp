 GRT Softmax Example
 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the Softmax algorithm for classification.
 
 The Softmax classifier is a simple but effective classifier based on logisitic regression that works well on problems that are linearly separable.
 
 In this example we create an instance of an Softmax algorithm and then train the algorithm using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained Softmax classification model is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create an initialize the Softmax algorithm
 - Load some ClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train the Softmax algorithm using the training dataset
 - Test the Softmax algorithm using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier

You should run this example with one argument pointing to the data you want to load. A good dataset to run this example is acc-orientation.grt, which can be found in the GRT data folder.
