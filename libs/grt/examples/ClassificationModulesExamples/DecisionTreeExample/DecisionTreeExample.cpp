/*
 GRT DecisionTree

 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the DecisionTree algorithm for classification.
 
 Decision Trees are conceptually simple classifiers that work well on even complex classification tasks.  
 Decision Trees partition the feature space into a set of rectangular regions, classifying a new datum by 
 finding which region it belongs to.
 
 In this example we create an instance of a DecisionTree algorithm and then train a model using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained DecisionTree model is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create and initialize the DecisionTree algorithm
 - Load some ClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train a DecisionTree model using the training dataset
 - Test the DecisionTree model using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier

You should run this example with one argument pointing to the data you want to load. A good dataset to run this example is acc-orientation.grt, which can be found in the GRT data folder.
