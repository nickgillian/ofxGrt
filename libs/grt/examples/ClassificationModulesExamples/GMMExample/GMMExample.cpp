 GRT GMM Example
 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the GMM algorithm for classification.
 
 The Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier (GMM) is basic but useful classification algorithm that can be used to
 classify an N-dimensional signal.
 
 In this example we create an instance of a GMM classifier and then train the algorithm using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained GMM algorithm is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create an initialize the GMM algorithm
 - Load some ClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train the GMM algorithm using the training dataset
 - Test the GMM algorithm using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier

You should run this example with one argument pointing to the data you want to load. A good dataset to run this example is acc-orientation.grt, which can be found in the GRT data folder.
