 GRT Random Forests Example
 
 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the RandomForests algorithm for classification.
 
 RandomForests are an ensemble learning method that operate by building a number of decision trees at training 
 time and outputting the class with the majority vote over all the trees in the ensemble.

 In this example we create an instance of a RandomForests algorithm and then train a model using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained RandomForests model is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create and initialize the RandomForests algorithm
 - Load some ClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train a RandomForests model using the training dataset
 - Test the RandomForests model using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier

You should run this example with one argument pointing to the data you want to load. A good dataset to run this example is acc-orientation.grt, which can be found in the GRT data folder.
