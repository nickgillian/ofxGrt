/*
 GRT AdaBoostExample

 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the AdaBoost algorithm for classification.
 
 AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a powerful classifier that works well on both basic and more complex recognition problems.
 AdaBoost works by combining several relatively weak classifiers together to form a highly accurate strong classifier.  AdaBoost
 therefore acts as a meta algorithm, which allows you to use it as a wrapper for other classifiers.  In the GRT, these classifiers
 are called WeakClassifiers such as a DecisionStump (which is just one node of a DecisionTree).
 
 In this example we create an instance of an AdaBoost algorithm and then train the algorithm using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained AdaBoost algorithm is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 This example uses the DecisionStump as the WeakClassifer, although AdaBoost works with any GRT WeakClassifier (including any you write yourself).
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create an initialize the AdaBoost algorithm
 - Set a DecisionStump as the WeakClassifer
 - Load some ClassificationData from a file and partition the data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train the AdaBoost algorithm using the training dataset
 - Test the AdaBoost algorithm using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier

 You should run this example with one argument pointing to the data you want to load. A good dataset to run this example is acc-orientation.grt, which can be found in the GRT data folder.
