 GRT HMM Continuous Example
 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the Continuous HMM algorithm for classification.
 
 Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are powerful classifiers that work well on temporal classification problems when you have a large training dataset.

 The HMM algorithm in the GRT can be either a discrete or continuous HMM.  A discrete HMM means that the input to the HMM algorithm must be a 
 discrete integer value in the range [0 numSymbols-1].  A continuous HMM means that the input to the HMM algorithm can be an N-dimensional 
 floating point vector.  For the discrete HMM, you can convert N-dimensional continuous data into a 1-dimensional discrete data using one of 
 the GRT Quantization algorithms, such as KMeansQuantizer.

 In this example we create an instance of a Continuous HMM algorithm and then train a Continuous HMM model using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained HMM algorithm is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create an initialize the Continuous HMM algorithm
 - Load some TimeSeriesClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Train the HMM algorithm using the training dataset
 - Test the HMM algorithm using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier
