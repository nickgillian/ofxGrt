 GRT DTW Example
 This examples demonstrates how to initialize, train, and use the DTW algorithm for classification.
 
 The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is a powerful classifier that works very well for recognizing temporal gestures.
 
 In this example we create an instance of an DTW algorithm and then train the algorithm using some pre-recorded training data.
 The trained DTW algorithm is then used to predict the class label of some test data.
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create an initialize the DTW algorithm
 - Load some LabelledTimeSeriesClassificationData from a file and partition the training data into a training dataset and a test dataset
 - Trim any periods of non-movement from the start and end of each timeseries recording 
 - Train the DTW algorithm using the training dataset
 - Test the DTW algorithm using the test dataset
 - Manually compute the accuracy of the classifier
