 @brief This class provides a simple working example of some custom feature extraction.
 
 The class implements an Accumulator feature extraction, this is a very simple feature extraction 
 (which is probably not very useful but is good for demonstrating how to create your own feature extraction)
 that takes the input, sums up the values, and then adds the last value (which is first multipled by a weight).
