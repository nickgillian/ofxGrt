 @brief This class provides an empty template to help you create your own custom FeatureExtraction module.
 You should rename this class (from FeatureExtractionTemplate to something more suitable for your custom module) and add
 your own custom code to the following methods:
 - Default Constructor, Copy Constructor, Destructor, and equals operator
 - clone
 - computeFeatures
 - reset
 - saveSettingsToFile
 - loadSettingsFromFile
